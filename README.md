# 🧳Travel Insurance Claim Prediction —  Capstone Project M3 Machine Learning
Hello! My name is Lutfi Aryadi Sukmono.

This is my third Capstone Project as a student at Purwadhika Digital Technology School, focusing on predicting travel insurance claim outcomes using Machine Learning.
The main objectives of this project are to clean and preprocess the dataset, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), develop and compare multiple machine learning classification models, handle imbalanced data, interpret model behavior using SHAP, and generate data-driven business insights and recommendations for insurance stakeholders.

🛠 **Tech Stack**
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, SHAP
- XGBoost, Imbalanced-Learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

🧠 **Machine Learning Models Tested**
- Some classification models were evaluated to find the best predictive performance:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- CatBoost
- Gradient Boosting
- KNN
- SVM

Final chosen model is based on balanced performance, especially for Recall & F1-Score, due to imbalanced target data.
